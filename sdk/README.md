# CipherDEX SDK Surface

The SDK surface is intentionally dependency-free. Discovery objects use the
versioned `DISCLOSURE_SCHEMA_VERSION` contract and must be rejected when the
version is unknown. It exports stable ABI
fragments and public pool-discovery types for dashboards, launchpads and third
parties. `privacyMode` is explicit: `0` is transparent public settlement and
`1` is amount-confidential settlement with private LP accounting. A fully
confidential recipient/identity mode is not implemented and must not be inferred
from either value. Public pool users can also use the factory-gated quoter and
exact-input router ABI fragments. Private pool swaps and quotes remain
direct-to-pool because COTI encrypted inputs bind the caller and target
contract.

Private amounts, reserves, balances and LP positions are not represented in the
discovery schema. Use the official COTI SDK and the caller's AES key for
caller-specific ciphertext preparation and decryption. Factory-created
confidential pools expose a pool-bound `PrivateLPToken`; its ABI fragment is
available for encrypted LP transfers and approvals, while aggregate
`totalSupply()` must not be used as a private-supply oracle.
